# tech-blog

## Description

This application is a tech blog site that allows users to comment, make posts, edit and delete posts, and see other user's posts. It serves as a place for users to have discussions about tech and programming. It was made using several npm packages as well as some api, PQL, postgreSQL, handlebars, and other things. It was made as a way to gain practice using Model View controller (MVC) structuring.

Thank you to the staff and my peers at UNCC, without you all my coding journey would be very difficult.

Particular note to the files with comments denoting that they're extremely similar to other files seen with similar code in them freqently throughout the course, thank you to the staff for those.
